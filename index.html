            <p>Red Five standing by. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith
                disturbing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
            <p>I'm trying not to, kid. He is here. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what
                you're best at, ain't it? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. <strong> I've seen
                    a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful
                    Force controlling everything.</strong> <em> There's no mystical energy field that controls my
                    destiny.</em> It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
            <h2>I call it luck.</h2>
            <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Obi-Wan is
                here. The Force is with him. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! As you wish.</p>
            <ol>

                <li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li>

            <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
                going. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. What good
                is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of
                courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
            <ul>

                <li>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's
                    nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</li>

                    idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</li>
                <li>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet
                    is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the
                Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for
                me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
            <p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home.
                It's late, I'm in for it as it is. He is here. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Don't be
                too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is
                insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
            <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The more you tighten
                your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. You are a part of the Rebel
                Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
            <p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is
                insignificant next to the power of the Force. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Dantooine. They're on
                Dantooine.</p>
            <p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? The Force is strong with this one. I
                have you now. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. A tremor in the
                Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
            <p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you
                think? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Look, I can
                take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
            <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to
                Alderaan-- What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station
                ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
            <p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the
                other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one
                all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.

            <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? She must have
                hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally,
                Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
